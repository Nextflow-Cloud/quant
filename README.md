# Quant
The official Discord link bot for Nextflow.

## Running
Install all dependencies by running the install command of your preferred package manager.
`npm install`
`yarn install`
`pnpm install`
Then, transpile the TypeScript files to JavaScript.
`npm run build`
`yarn build`
`pnpm run build`
The included build of Lavalink has been tested with OpenJDK 18. Change to the `lavalink` directory (very important) so that the configuration file is in the same directory. To run the bot, first start the Lavalink server. 
`java -jar Lavalink.jar`
After the server has started and you have seen the text saying "Started Launcher" you may run the bot.
`npm start`
`yarn start`
`pnpm start`
